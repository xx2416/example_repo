I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 3

This is going to make a plot
echo was used to display or markdwon the code

```{r chunk_scatterplot, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
plot_df=
  tibble(
    x=rnorm(n=1000),
    y=1+2*x+rnorm(n=1000)
  )
ggplot(plot_df,aes(x,y))+geom_point()
```

```{r learning_accessment_1}
la_df=tibble(
  x=rnorm(500,mean = 1),
  logical=x>0,
  abs_norm=abs(x)
)
ggplot(la_df,aes(x=abs_norm))+geom_histogram()
```
* The mean of the sample is `r mean(pull(la_df, x))`
* The median of the sample is `r median(pull(la_df, x))`
* The median of the sample is `r median(pull(la_df, x))`
